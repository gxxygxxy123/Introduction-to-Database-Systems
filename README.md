# Introduction-to-Database-Systems
It's a course about the database.

In the homework we have to design a website by PHP.
The website is about the house management system, in which you can see the information of other's houses.

We use the database of our school's CS department database service: https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cscc/mysql/
