It's a course about the database.
* Register/Delete Accounts.
* Everyone can create/delete or manage their own houses, and add others' houses to their favorite list.
* If you are admins, you can manage other accounts, the house information list and house location list.
* SQL injection defense.

In the homework we have to design a website by PHP.
The website is about the house management system, in which you can see the information of other's houses.

We use the database of our school's CS department database service: https://www.cs.nctu.edu.tw/cscc/mysql/
